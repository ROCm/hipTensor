Welcome! hiptensor is AMD's C++ library for accelerating tensor primitives using GPU matrix cores on AMD's latest discrete GPUs.

## Requirements

hipTensor currently supports the following AMDGPU architectures:

* CDNA class GPU featuring matrix core support: gfx908, gfx90a, gfx940, gfx941, gfx942 as 'gfx9'

:::{note}
Double precision FP64 datatype support requires gfx90a, gfx940, gfx941 or gfx942
:::

Dependencies:

* Minimum ROCm version support is 6.0.
* Minimum cmake version support is 3.14.
* Minimum ROCm-cmake version support is 0.8.0.
* Minimum Composable Kernel version support is composable_kernel 1.1.0 for ROCm 6.0.2 (or ROCm package composablekernel-dev).
* Minimum HIP runtime version support is 4.3.0 (or ROCm package ROCm hip-runtime-amd).
* Minimum LLVM dev package version support is 10.0 (available as ROCm package rocm-llvm-dev).

Optional:

* doxygen (for building documentation)

## Build with CMake

### Example configurations

By default, the project is configured as Release mode. Here are some of the examples for the configuration:

| Configuration                    | Command                                                                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic                            | `CC=hipcc CXX=hipcc cmake -B<build_dir> .`                                |
| Targeting gfx908                 | `CC=hipcc CXX=hipcc cmake -B<build_dir> . -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx908:xnack-` |
| Debug build                      | `CC=hipcc CXX=hipcc cmake -B<build_dir> . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`       |
| Build without tests (default on) | `CC=hipcc CXX=hipcc cmake -B<build_dir> . -DHIPTENSOR_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`    |

After configuration, build with `cmake --build <build_dir> -- -j<nproc>`.
