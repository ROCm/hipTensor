* Used `GPU_TARGETS` instead of `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in `cmakelists.txt`
* Binary sizes can be reduced on supported compilers by using the `--offload-compress` compiler flag

### Optimized

* Optimized the hyper-parameter selection algorithm for permutation

### Resolved issues

* For CMake bug workaround, set `CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH` when `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` is unset

## hipTensor 1.4.0 for ROCm 6.3.0

### Added

* Added support for tensor reduction, including APIs, CPU reference, unit tests, and documentation

### Changed

* ASAN builds only support xnack+ targets.

* Updated the permute backend to accommodate changes to element-wise operations.
* Updated the actor-critic implementation.

### Optimized

* Split kernel instances to improve build times

### Resolved issues

* Fixed a bug in randomized tensor input data generation.
* Fixed the default strides calculation to be in column major order.
* Fixed a small memory leak by properly destroying HIP event objects in tests.
* Default strides calculations now follow column-major convention.
