hiptensor: A High-Performance HIP Library For Tensor Primitives
============================================================================

hiptensor is AMD's C++ library for accelerating tensor primitives based on the composable kernels,
which aims to provide a programming model for writing performance critical kernels for machine learning
workloads across multiple architectures including GPUs, CPUs, etc, through general purpose kernel 
languages, like HIP C++.
